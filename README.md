#### :memo: HTML5 :memo:

**HTML 5** is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.  The goals are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices; and to remain backward compatible to older software.  Many new symantic features are included.

#### :art: CSS :art:

**Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language (such as HTML5).  CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content; including layout, colors, and fonts.  This separation improves content accessibility to provide more flexibility and control in the secification of presentation characteristics, enabling multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying relevant CSS in a separate file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content (HTML) as well as enabling the file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

Separation of formating and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice, and on Braille-based tactile devices.

#### :page_with_curl: MaterializeCSS :page_with_curl:

**MaterializeCSS** combines the classic principles of successful design along with innovation and technology. The goal is to develop a system of design that allows for a unified user experience across all their products on any platform.

Elements and components such as grids, typography, color, and imagery are not only visually pleasing, but also create a sense of hierarchy, meaning, and focus.

#### :sparkler: JavaScript :sparkler:

**JavaScript (JS)** is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web (along with HTML and CSS). It enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.  JS is a multi-faceted, scripting language that provides versatility through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation, among others.
